## Gesture Recognition: American Sign Language Detection
Description: In our project, we aim to correctly detect and recogznie 
hand gesture for american sign language. We will first try to implement 
the solution according to the paper found on ieeeExplorer "Alphabet 
Sign Language Image Classification Using Deep Learning".
For the classification, the dataset "ASL Finger Spelling Dataset" of the paper 
"Spelling It Out: Real-Time ASL Fingerspelling Recognition" will be used. 
The dataset consists of over 50'000 images of letters formed by the hands. 
They are seperated in 24 classes. The alphabet J and Z are not included since 
it needs movement to do the sign. We will only focus on static images.
