## Gesture Recognition: American Sign Language Detection
Description: In our project, we aim to correctly detect and recogznie 
hand gesture for american sign language. We will first try to implement 
the solution according to the paper found on ieeeExplorer "Alphabet 
Sign Language Image Classification Using Deep Learning". 
For the classification, the dataset "ASL-Alphabet" of Kaggle will be used. 
The dataset consists of 87'000 200x200 pixels images which are seperated 
in 29 classes (A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING). 
But we will omit the alphabet J and Z since it needs movement to do the 
sign. We will only focus on static images.
